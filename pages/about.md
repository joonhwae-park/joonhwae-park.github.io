I'm a second year Ph.D. student in Information Systems at Emory University.


## Research Interests
My research interest lies at the intersection between societal and technical aspects of the real world. In terms of methodologies, I focus on integrating **Machine Learning with Causal Inference**. Specifically, I'm interested in considering multiple modalities together to uncover novel features that can explain the mechanism of human decision-making within the context of **{E-commerce, Online Platform}**. Additionally, I am passionate about exploring **Recommender Systems** through **{Experimental Design, Agent-based Simulation}**. Currently, I am particularly interested in 1) improving evaluation methods and 2) enhancing negative sampling techniques.


## Working Papers
