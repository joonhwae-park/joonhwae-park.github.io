## Research Interests
My research interest lies at the intersection between societal and technical aspects of the real world. In terms of methodologies, I focus on integrating **Machine Learning with Causal Inference**. Specifically, I'm interested in considering multiple modalities together to uncover novel features that can explain the mechanism of human behavior within the context of **{E-commerce, Online Platform}**. Additionally, I am passionate about exploring  **Algorithmic Fairness**. For example, I have curiosity about trade-offs between algorithmic bias and consumer bias. Building on my past experiences in finance, I am also intrigued by how **Fintech** has transformed consumer behavior and financial markets.
