**Research Interests**\\
My research interest lies at the interaction between societal and technical aspects of the real world. In terms of methodologies, I work on applying **Machine Learning with Causal Inference**. Specifically, I'm interested in considering several modalities together to find out novel features that can explain the mechanism of human behavior on **{E-commerce, Online Platform}** context. Moreover, I'm willing to conduct researches about **Algorithmic Fairness**. In more detail, I have curiosity about tradeoffs between algorithm bias and consumer bias. Also, based on my past experiences related to finance, I'm interested in how **Fintech** altered consumer behavior and financial markets.
